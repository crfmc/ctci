## Reading Guide for Cracking the Coding Interview

This is a repository built for container solutions and other explorations
of topics mentioned in the book by Gayle McDowell.

## Disclaimer

None of the problems belong to me, they have been copied directly
from the pages of ()[the book].

Some of the problems found in the scratchpad directory are meant
as additional practice problems found elsewhere, as well as
exploratory code written to investigate topics such as bitwise
manipulations and other features of JavaScript's wonderful language.

For specific notes, check out the notes folder, which is made up of mostly
comments about a particular facet of JavaScript.

## Testing
The lib folder is reserved for creating an OOP heirarchy of data structures.
Sometimes, the answer to a problem will consist of creating such a 
data-structure, or a method for a particular data-structure. In these
cases, said data-structure will simply be imported, and in the case of
the method, it will be called.
