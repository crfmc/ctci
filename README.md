## Reading Guide for Cracking the Coding Interview

This is a repository built for container solutions and other explorations
of topics mentioned in the book by Gayle McDowell.

## Disclaimer

None of the problems belong to me, they have been copied directly
from the pages of ()[the book].

Some of the problems found in the scratchpad directory are meant
as additional practice problems found elsewhere, as well as
explortory code written to investigate topics such as bitwise
manipulations and JavaScript's wonderful language.
